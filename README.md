# Insane

Dream Simulator

## Dream?

Dream is a YouTuber featuring world level Minecraft (hacking) techniques.

This mod is aimed at reproduce his speedrun with 
[Baritone API](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone).

## Sounds cool. Where can I get it?

You can't get it. By getting it I mean downloading a stable release where you
get a working Dream simulator.

However, the latest snapshot release can be downloaded from
[my CI](https://build.zhufucdev.com/job/Insane/1/console).
They are highly unstable. Try if you wanna go insane.
